# Introduction

## Motivation
It is pretty common that university students are required to do an individual/group project. It could be a software app, a survey, an experiment, etc. Whatever the project is, the fact is that participants ARE NEEDED, be they test users, surveyees, or experiment subjects! So often we see students posting their advertisements and invitations in random Telegram groups, on personal websites, or at bus stops, but very few really respond. As a result, a lot of Telegram groups, such as module discussion groups (the GEA1000 group is the worst) and interest groups, are full of spam. Personal websites end up having low views. Bulletin boards at bus stops are also messed up by an overwhelming number of posters. Other students are distracted and bothered, so they pay even less attention to similar advertisements in the future. It is hard for initiators to find participants, and conversely, if there are students who would like to participate in their peers’ works, they cannot find the /experiments/surveys which interest them. So what goes wrong? Why is it so hard for project developers to find other students to participate in their projects? We believe this is due to the following reasons:
1. The absence of a platform that serves as a bridge or an agent between project developers and potential participants. Information is not aggregated but instead, dispersed. Therefore, different project developers seek participants individually but do not have the opportunity to post their requests onto a shared public platform. Potential participants do not have enough information about what projects are ongoing and might interest them.
2. The lack of a reward system that really motivates people to participate.
3. Project developers only focus on their own projects, but they can also be each other’s participants. They are the ones who have the strongest incentive to participate in others’ projects, if other developers participate in theirs in return. However, there has yet to be a platform on which developers from different projects can collaborate.

Hence, we want to produce a solution to these three problems.

## Aims
* Build a centralised platform that serves as a bridge and an agent between project developers and potential participants. Information is to be aggregated and shared on it.
* Invite more users to use software projects developed by students.
* Build a mutually beneficial, collaborative platform where project developers and researchers can participate in each other’s projects.
* Assist research group/student organisations/non-profit institutions in recruiting volunteers for experiments/surveys/social work.
* Encourage students to contribute ideas to solve practical issues they encounter in everyday life, and motivate those who have the technical skills to implement the solutions.
* Involve students in the process of ranking/advertising the projects of their peers, enabling them to support those projects that engage or benefit them the most.

## Scope
The target audience is all Singapore university / polytechnic students.
The platform IS NOT:
* A job market where people apply for jobs and internships
* A social networking platform
* A school forum where people talk about issues at university
	
The platform DOES NOT:
* Accept commercial entities to post their projects to seek more users for commercial / marketing purposes
* Tell the project developers how to improve their projects, such as debugging. They should make sure their projects work before they invite participants.

## User Stories 
The core of the mechanism is called the Participation Point system.
* As a software project developer, I can use my Participation Points to boost the ranking of my project, so that more users on the platform can see it and participate in alpha/beta testing or simply use my program. 
* As a researcher, I can similarly use the Participation Points to advertise my experiment/survey so that users attracted can complete questionnaires and sign up for volunteers directly on the platform. 
* As a software project developer or a researcher, I can actively participate in other developers’ projects and other researchers’ experiments/surveys on the platform, or rank a project/survey/experiment and leave a comment about it, so that I can earn more Participation Points to support my project.
* As a student who does not have the specific skill set to solve a problem that troubles me in everyday life, I can post the problem or propose a solution on the platform, so that I gain participation points, and those who have the skills are encouraged to implement the solution for me.
* As a student who has the skills but does not know what to do for my project/research/survey, I can browse for ideas on the platform so that I implement something that targets other users’ needs and problems while being rewarded Participation Points.
* As a normal student, I can earn Participation Points and transfer them to my friends, so that they can advertise their project/experiment/survey.
* As a normal student, I also leave good comments and donate my Participation Points, so that I can endorse my favourite projects/experiments/surveys.
